# odin-recipes
First Odin Project in HTML
This is the first Odin project. The goal is to create a basic recipe website, using all of the HTML knowledge acquired. 
The recipe page must include a main index page, which will have links to a few recipes. 
Some of the main elements on this webpage will be: HTML boilerplate, head, title, p, strong (bold), em (italic), links, and images. 
Keep in mind that the first few drafts will not look pretty. The idea is to practice constructing the webpage using HTML elements and attributes. I will be coming back to this project once in CSS to style the page.
